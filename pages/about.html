    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p class="center"><em>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ela, and Balloon Atelier is my small, family-run party decor business based in Wandsworth.</em></p>
    <p>
      I specialise in everyday air-filled balloon creations for all sorts of events.  
      From premium number stacks to decorating welcome easels to grab-and-go balloon garlands, your parties are my passion. 
      I can also help you to hire lead numbers, sequin walls, neon signs and decorate your tables to give your guests that extra wow factor.
    </p>

      <h4 slot="card-title">My story</h4>
      <p slot="card-body">
        When the balloon lady working for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrstipi_marbella/">@mrstipi_marbella</a> let her down, she called me to help her out with the party she was setting up.  
        At first, I thought that all I'd need to do was just blow up a few balloons.  
        When I realised what Tatyana really needed, I nearly fainted! 
        I didn't give it a second thought and enrolled on a course straightaway, determined not to let my friend's reputation down.
      </p>
      <p slot="card-body">
        On the big day, I made plenty of rookie mistakes - picture balloons flying out of my car windows! 
        But guess what? The display turned out beautifully, and I have not looked back since.  
        I've been attending workshops and seminars to stay on top of the latest trends. 
        I'm always working to hone my skills so I can create curated displays for any celebration, to help transform your space into something magical.
