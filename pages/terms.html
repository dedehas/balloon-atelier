  <h5>Delivery and Balloon Installations</h5>
  <p>
    Setup time will be dependent on the size of the balloon decor.
    These times will be discussed when you place your order.
    Our delivery and installation charge fee depends on the location of the event and the complexity of the set up.
    This will take into account any additional working hours, travel time and travel costs.
  </p>

  <h5>Foils</h5>
  <p>
    During transit of any foil balloon displays the foil balloons may deflate due to temperature change.
    However, once back in a warm house the foils will inflate to original size.
    Foil balloon displays are made up to 24 hours before collection/delivery.
    This is to ensure there are no faults with any balloons before collection/delivery.

  <h5>Outdoor Events</h5>
  <p>
    We use only the highest quality products and make every possible effort that your decor will meet or exceed your expectations.
    However, due to the general nature of balloons, we cannot guaranteed that your balloons will remain perfect and intact when outdoors.
    Some balloons will occasionally deflate sooner than expected when outdoors and will also be adversely affected by wind, rain, extreme heat and rough handling.
  </p>
    
  <h5>Sun Damage</h5>
  <p>
    On the off-chance the sun is shining bright enough to cause any damage, it is worth noting that if left in the sun balloons can fade in colour (oxidise).
    When the weather is too hot then the sun may even cause a few balloons to pop.
    Also, please note that balloons can turn matte when used outside.  
  </p>
    
  <h5>Safety Warnings</h5>
  <p>
    Balloons can cause a choking hazard and once the balloons have been delivered and Balloon Atelier has left the location, we no longer accept any liability.
