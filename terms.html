  Please read our terms and conditions carefully before confirming any orders with Balloon Atelier.  
  Your use of our services is conditioned upon your acceptance of these terms.
  By using Balloon Atelier you agree to be bound by these terms.  We reserve the right to modify or replace these terms at any time.

  Booking
  An event or order is only considered “booked” after a 50% non-refundable booking deposit is made.
  This initial deposit reserves the event time and date of your order.  The remaining balance must be paid no later that the week before your event, delivery or collection.

  Payments

  Payments can be made by bank transfer.  Failure to make the deposit payment will result in your booking not being secured and no balloons will be ordered for you.

  Cancelling and Rescheduling

  Rescheduling

  The client may reschedule their installation or order at least one week prior to the agreed date.  If these terms are met the client may transfer their deposit over to another date.  The client can reschedule their order/event within the next 12 calendar months at the convenience of Balloon Atelier.

  Cancellation

  The client maintains the right to cancel at any time.  Howsoever, we place the order for the balloons and materials needed for your balloon decoration project the same day you place your order and pay the 50% deposit.  So, in return, we are not able to refund deposits made.

  Changes to Orders

  Deleting decor pieces cannot be made on any orders after your balloon decor has been ordered.
  Adding decor pieces can only be made if there is at least 7 days before installation/event/delivery/collection.
  Colour changes will result in additional charges to cover costs.

  Delivery and Balloon Installations

  Setup time will be dependent on the size of the balloon decor.  These times will be discussed when you place your order.
  Our delivery and installation charge fee depends on the location of the event and the complexity of the set up. This will take into account any additional workinghours, travel time and travel costs.

  Arrival

  Access to an event location must be secured and confirmed by the client with the venue.  Balloon Atelier cannot be held responsible for delays if a reasonable amount of time is not allocated to complete the decor installation.

  Damages and Stolen Items

  Frames and Props
  Any damage caused to the frames or props after we have left the location of setup is to be paid for by the customer.  Any stolen props or frames will also be paid for.

  Flowers
  Any missing or damaged faux flowers are to be paid for by the customer.
  By accepting these Terms and Conditions you are accepting that any damages and stolen items will be paid for.

  Collection of Balloon Decor
  Once the balloon decor has been collected by the client, Balloon Atelier accepts no liability for any damage caused during transit.

  Material Guarantee 
  All materials are guaranteed to be as specified with the manufacturer.  If the supplier or manufacturer is out of stock on a product, Balloon Atelier reserves the right to substitute an item of like kind and quality.  

  Foils
  During transit of any foil balloon displays the foil balloons may deflate due to temperature change.  However, once back in a warm house the foils will inflate to original size.  Foil balloon displays are made up to 24 hours before collection/delivery.  This is to ensure there are no faults with any balloons before collection/delivery.

  Outdoor Events
  We use only the highest quality products and make every possible effort that your decor will meet or exceed your expectations.  However, due to the general nature of balloons, we cannot guaranteed that your balloons will remain perfect and intact when outdoors.  Some balloons will occasionally deflate sooner than expected when outdoors and will also be adversely affected by wind, rain, extreme heat and rough handling.

  Sun Damage

  On the off-chance the sun is shining bright enough to cause any damage, it is worth noting that if left in the sun balloons can fade in colour (oxidise).  When the weather is too hot then the sun may even cause a few balloons to pop.  Also, please note that balloons can turn matte when used outside.  

  Safety Warnings

  Balloons can cause a choking hazard and once the balloons have been delivered and Balloon Atelier has left the location, we no longer accept any liability.  Children should be monitored to ensure they do not swallow any balloon parts.

  Disclaimer

  We use professional equipment and materials as intended for its particular purpose within all designs.  To limit the risk of damage we recommend that all decor remain in the position they were installed in.  As stated above, any damage caused to the equipment used, is to be paid for by the customer.

  Command Hooks

  If there are no photo hooks or curtain poles available to hang any balloon decor on, then we may use command hooks.  If removed correctly these will not cause any damage to the walls.  However, there is still a possibility this may happen or marks may be left.  Balloon Atelier accepts no liability in the event this happens.
  Balloon Atelier accepts no liability for any damage caused by any of the balloon decor displays.
